"""apf/foundation_inputs.py -- Executable witness for the canonical 4-input
declaration of Admissibility Physics + the derivation of PLEC's four
constitutive features from that declaration.

Phase 42 (2026-05-04 LATER): codebase landing of the LATER-9 input-set
collapse 5 → 4 (Paper 0 v6.0.5 + Paper 1 supplement v8.22+).  The framework's
canonical input set is exactly four:

    1. FD1 -- Physical identity = finite admissible continuation identity.
    2. FD2 -- Physical distinction = finite enforceable separator of
       continuation profiles.
    3. FD3 -- Physical distinctions carry positive enforcement cost.
    4. Finite-physical-regime hypothesis: C_Γ < ∞ at every interface.

All other commitments named anywhere in the corpus (PLEC's four constitutive
features A1/MD/A2/BW, the marginal floor ε* > 0, the Sep/IJC dichotomy, the
κ_int two-sided structural rigidity, the R1-R4 robust-finite-interface
conditions) are derivable consequences of these four under Paper 10 v1.12
§3.5 reductions.

This module provides two bank-registered checks witnessing the foundation:

  * check_T_four_input_declaration -- certifies that the canonical witness
    APS satisfies all four inputs and that no other primitive commitment is
    needed to support the spine.

  * check_T_PLEC_derived_from_spine -- certifies that A1, MD, A2, BW are
    each derivable from the four-input declaration: A1 = finite-physical-
    regime hypothesis directly; MD-value = ε* > 0 as the second half of the
    finite-physical-regime hypothesis with the tested/gauge cleavage from
    FD2; A2 = argmin from cost-as-infimum + no-waste under saturation; BW =
    cost-spectrum non-degeneracy from MD via the Lemma BW reduction.

Each check is bank-registered with epistemic tag [P_structural], tier 4.

Source-of-record: Paper 0 v6.0.5 §3.1 (4-input declaration) + Paper 1
Supplement v8.22+ §1 ("Inputs, in one place") + Paper 10 v1.12 §3.5
(Lemmas A2 + BW).

On operational language.  This module witnesses static algebraic relations
on admissibility space -- the input declaration is a structural commitment,
not a process.  What reads in the prose below as "primitive," "input,"
"commitment" is the local reading of those static relations under the
operational vocabulary of physics.  Paper 0's Descriptive Reading chapter
+ Paper 1 supplement v8.31 §1 carry the eternalist convention.
