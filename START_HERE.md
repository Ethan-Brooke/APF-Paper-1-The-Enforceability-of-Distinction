**If you are an AI agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cursor, Continue, autonomous coding agent, anything): read this file fully before doing anything else in this repository. It is a checklist, not a narrative. Work through it in order.**

If you are a human: `README.md` is written for you. This file is for AI assistants, but you're welcome to read it.

## Why this file exists

AI agents have a recurring failure mode on this project: responding to APF requests with fluent-but-wrong output because the relevant context was never loaded. This file is the minimum context load to reason about Paper 1 of the APF series honestly.

This file is structured in three tiers. **Tier 1** (§0 below) is the 60-second mental map — read it even if you plan to skip everything else. **Tier 2** (§1 corpus table + §2 the seven steps) is 5–10 minutes of operational loading; it is what the "ready to work" state actually requires. **Tier 3** (§3 + `REVIEWERS_GUIDE.md` + the manuscript itself) is full audit depth, only when the task demands it.

## §0 — 60-second mental map (Tier 1)

<!-- CUSTOM:start id=mental_map_v8.32 -->

**The structural referent.** APF is a structural-realist framework whose primary commitment is to *admissibility space* — the structural object physics is articulated on at every causally-connected interface (Paper 0 v6.0 + Paper 1 supplement v8.32). Admissibility space is not a substance; it is the pattern of finite admissible continuations together with the cost structure that distinguishes physical identity from non-identity.

**Three primitive commitments + one regime hypothesis = 4 inputs total.** The framework's input set is exactly four (Paper 0 v6.0.5 + Paper 1 supplement v8.32 §1; LATER-9 input collapse 5 → 4):

1. **FD1** — physical identity = finite admissible continuation identity.
2. **FD2** — physical distinction = finite enforceable separator of continuation profiles.
3. **FD3** — physical distinctions carry positive enforcement cost.
4. **Finite-physical-regime hypothesis**: $C_\Gamma < \infty$ at every causally-connected region.

These four are witnessed executable in `apf/foundation_inputs.py:check_T_four_input_declaration` (tier-4 [P_structural]). No fifth input is invoked anywhere in the corpus.

**PLEC's four features (A1, MD, A2, BW) are derived consequences, not primitives.** Under Paper 10 v1.12 §3.5 reductions:
- **A1** (capacity bound) = finite-physical-regime hypothesis half-1 directly.
- **MD-value** ($\varepsilon^* > 0$) = finite-physical-regime hypothesis half-2; MD's tested/gauge cleavage = FD2's separator-vs-relabeling distinction.
- **A2** (argmin selection) = derived from cost-as-infimum + no-waste under saturation.
- **BW** (cost-spectrum non-degeneracy) = derived from MD via Lemma BW.

Witnessed in `apf/foundation_inputs.py:check_T_PLEC_derived_from_spine`.

**Eternalist commitment.** Time is derived in this corpus (Paper 3 derives the arrow of time as the loss of global admissible coordination; Paper 6 derives the metric and dimensionality of spacetime). Operational vocabulary throughout the corpus — "evolution," "enforcement," "maintenance," "perturbation" — is the local reading of static admissibility-space structure under temporal slicing. The framework sits in the company of block-universe / Wheeler–DeWitt / Page–Wootters readings. Paper 0 §1 + Paper 1 supplement v8.32 §1 carry the canonical convention.

**What this paper contributes (§9 + §11 + §14.5 of v8.32).** The Paper 1 supplement delivers four formal endpoints from the 4-input spine:

- **Sep/IJC classification** of finite tested interfaces (Paper 1 supplement §sep-ijc-representation): every quantum-capable interface is in branch (Sep) — a faithful commuting Boolean record defender exists — or branch (IJC) — no faithful commuting completion can be built.
- **Noncommutative continuation structure** on the (IJC) branch (the bridge L_Δ → T1 → T_adj → L_blk → T_alg).
- **κ_int two-sided structural rigidity** (§9 + §14.5): the interface-cost residue $\kappa_{\Gamma,\mathrm{int}}$ is bounded between explicit substrate-derived endpoints (lower from MD/BW unconditional; upper from kernel-norm conditional on C1–C5). Audit-flagged "free functional" complaint formally closed.
- **R1–R4 spine-derivation** (§11): the four robust-finite-interface conditions are derivable consequences of the spine + operational interrogation, not added regularity hypotheses. The floor theorem proof uses MD's uniform floor directly (no compactness, no LSC, no Weierstrass infimum-attainment theorem imported); witnessed by `kappa_int_bounds.py:check_T_R1_R4_spine_derivable` + `check_T_minimum_distinction_floor_via_MD`.

The standard ascent from the noncommutative continuation algebra to complex Hilbert representation, Born rule, and Tsirelson-type bounds is previewed and deferred to Paper 5.

**What this repo verifies vs what it imports.** This repo locally verifies 23 theorem checks drawn from Paper 1's dependency subset (16 core spine + 5 κ_int structural rigidity + 2 foundation-input witnesses). Results from no other papers are imported, not re-derived here. The full APF corpus (and which paper owns which result) is in §1 below.

**Scope — after reading only this repo:**

- **You may:** summarize Paper 1's argument and results; explain the local 23-theorem subset; run all bundled checks to verify them; cite the paper by its DOI.
- **You may not:** claim mastery of the full APF corpus on the basis of this repo alone; re-derive results that belong to other papers using only material here; present imported results as locally derived in this repo; treat the bundled check subset as the whole engine (the canonical bank is 471 theorems / 488 checks; this repo contains a subset).

**Canonical state (one source of truth).** Codebase **v7.9**, frozen 2026-05-04. Full engine: **488** verify_all checks, **471** bank-registered theorems, **28** modules + standalone subpackage, **48** quantitative predictions, **0** free parameters. This repo bundles 23 of those checks. If you see a different count anywhere, this line is canonical.

## §1 — The corpus at a glance (Tier 1)

This repo is **one paper-companion** in an 11-paper core derivational series (Papers 0–10, plus Paper 13 as master reference). Papers 9 and 10 — the geometric substrate ontology capstone and the continuation-calculus language layer — were promoted into the core sequence at LATER-9 (2026-05-04). Before you treat any claim as the whole framework, know what else exists.

You are reading the companion to **Paper 1** (this repo: https://github.com/Ethan-Brooke/APF-Paper-1-The-Enforceability-of-Distinction). The canonical computational engine lives at codebase **v7.9** ([Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18529115)). Each paper has its own companion repo following the same layout.

**When in doubt about scope:** if the question is about a result outside Paper 1, point the user (or yourself) to the relevant paper above. Do not try to derive it from the bundled subset; the canonical state is the codebase, not this slice.

**Machine-readable equivalent.** For programmatic use, [`ai_context/repo_map.json`](ai_context/repo_map.json), [`ai_context/theorems.json`](ai_context/theorems.json), and [`ai_context/derivation_graph.json`](ai_context/derivation_graph.json) are the primary machine interfaces — they encode the same corpus inventory, full theorem catalog, and dependency DAG in structured form. For AI agents, those three JSON files are often more useful than the prose of this file. Root-level copies are also present at the repo root for discoverability.

## §2 — Operational loading (Tier 2): the seven steps

### Step 1 — Verify the code runs (30 seconds)

Before anything else, confirm the executable bank works on your system:

```bash
pip install -e .
python run_checks.py
```

Expected output: `Paper 1 (The Enforceability of Distinction: Quantum Structure from Finite Enforcement Capacity): N passed, 0 failed, N total — verified in under 1s`.

If any check fails, **stop**. Do not proceed with substantive work. Report the failure to the user with the full message; this is either a bug, a platform issue, or a genuine falsification candidate, and each has a different disposition.

### Step 2 — Read `ai_context/AGENTS.md` (2 minutes)

Mandatory. This file establishes:

- What this repo is (Paper 1 + vendored `apf/` subset)
- Trust hierarchy (code > supplement > paper > README > wiki)
- The seven specific failure modes AI agents have actually hit on this project
- The current canonical state (v7.8, 440 theorems, four-parameter Planck match)
- The H0 falsifier (so you don't reflexively try to "fix" it with the Grok-style mechanism already rejected)

### Step 3 — Absorb the framework in 5 minutes (`ai_context/FRAMEWORK_OVERVIEW.md`)

Mandatory. This gives you:

- Axiom A1 in one sentence
- PLEC's four components (A1 + MD + A2 + BW)
- The 61-partition ($C_{\mathrm{total}} = 61 = 42 + 3 + 16$), and why it's topological not dynamical
- The derivation chain (A1 → L_nc → L_irr → L_col → Theorem_R → T_gauge → T_field → T4F → ...)
- The 19 bank modules
- The 48 quantitative predictions and the four-parameter Planck cosmological match
- What APF IS and what APF IS NOT (scope boundary)

### Step 4 — Check vocabulary (`ai_context/GLOSSARY.md`)

Skim, don't memorize. Must know by sight:

- **Axioms:** A1 (finite capacity), MD (minimum distinction cost), A2 (argmin selection), BW (non-degeneracy)
- **PLEC primitives:** admissible class $\mathcal{A}_\Gamma$, enforcement-cost functional $E_\Gamma$, PLEC selection $X^*$
- **Regime R** (R1–R4 conditions for PLEC well-posedness) + the **five-type regime-exit taxonomy** (Types I–V)
- **Epistemic tags:** [P] / [P]+[I] / [P_structural] / [Pred] — these are load-bearing, not decorative
- **L_irr** — locally unrecoverable correlations, **NOT** "infinite-cost reversal" (the old framing is explicitly rejected)

### Step 5 — Load the theorem catalog (`ai_context/theorems.json`)

Not mandatory to read end-to-end, but make sure you know it exists and how to query it. The full bank has 440 entries; this paper bundles **18 of 440** for local execution. Each entry has name, module, epistemic tag, dependencies, and one-line summary.

Querying examples (use when you need to cite a specific theorem):

```bash
# Find all [P]-tagged theorems in core.py
jq '.entries[] | select(.module == "core" and .epistemic == "P") | .name' ai_context/theorems.json

# Find theorems bundled in this repo
jq '.entries[] | select(.bundled_in_this_repo) | .name' ai_context/theorems.json

# Find dependencies of a specific check
jq '.entries[] | select(.name == "T7B") | .dependencies' ai_context/theorems.json
```

The DAG is also available as structured data at `ai_context/derivation_graph.json` (368 nodes, 1516 edges) if you need to traverse dependencies.

### Step 6 — Internalize the engagement discipline (`ai_context/AUDIT_DISCIPLINE.md`)

**Mandatory before proposing any substantive edit or critiquing any external proposal.** This file codifies the audit-response posture the project requires:

- Read carefully before responding; verify claims against the current document (use `grep` / `read`, not your memory)
- Acknowledge gaps before proposing fixes
- Word distinctions that matter (bibliography ≠ literature review; citation ≠ positioning; derivation ≠ reinterpretation; "stated" ≠ "closed")
- Epistemic tag meanings — don't ship a [P_structural] claim as if it were a [P]

**Read the §8 worked example (the Grok H0 proposal) carefully.** It's the specific failure mode this discipline prevents. Understanding it is the fastest way to internalize the posture.

### Step 7 — Know what's genuinely open (`ai_context/OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`)

Do not attempt to "solve" any problem on this list without first checking the verdicts. Each entry documents why it's open, which escape routes are blocked by [P] theorems, and what would be required to close it honestly. The ten current open problems:

1. **H0 tension** (7.09σ vs H0DN 2026) — five escape routes catalogued; routes I and II blocked by [P] theorems
2. Absolute mass scales for $m_t$ and $m_b$
3. $m_c$ at 2.6% (Schur structural limit)
4. Dark matter particle identity (geometric sector identification is [P_structural + Pred])
5. PLEC existence/uniqueness theorem
6. Formal regime-exit theorem
7. DESI DR3+ confrontation
8. Neutrino CP phase derivation
9. Quantum-gravity / Planck-scale unification
10. Matter-content bridge tightening

---

## You are now ready

If you've completed steps 1–7, you should be able to:

- **Verify any claim in this paper** by finding its `\coderef{check_X}{module.py}` anchor, running the check, and reading the docstring.
- **Trace any derivation** from axioms to conclusion using `theorems.json` or `derivation_graph.json`.
- **Position any claim** against external literature with appropriate epistemic-tag precision.
- **Critique external proposals** against the framework's known [P]-theorem constraints without reinventing the Grok H0 failure mode.
- **Propose new work** with honest scope, not the shallow version.

## Self-check — answer these before proceeding

Before doing substantive work, confirm you can answer these three questions without re-reading:

1. **What is the 61-partition, and why is it topological rather than dynamical?**
   *(Expected: $61 = 42 + 3 + 16$ split by gauge-addressability and confinement predicates applied to the anomaly-free field content; see `check_L_saturation_partition` in cosmology.py. Type-counting, not capacity-amount dependent.)*

2. **What is APF's H0 prediction, and what is the tension with H0DN 2026?**
   *(Expected: $H_0 = 67.76$ km/s/Mpc from $\Omega_m = 19/61$ and Planck's measured $\Omega_m h^2 = 0.143$; 7.09σ tension with H0DN's $73.50 \pm 0.81$. Named [P] theorems that would have to be demoted to accommodate: L_equation_of_state, L_saturation_partition, L_anomaly_free.)*

3. **What does [P]+[I] mean, and how is it different from [P]?**
   *(Expected: [P] is internally derived from APF axioms; [P]+[I] means APF prepares the admissible class and an external mathematical theorem — Solèr, Gleason, HKM, Malament, Lovelock — closes the classification or uniqueness. The external theorem is an import, not an APF-internal derivation.)*

If you can't answer any of these confidently, re-read the relevant file. Answering them correctly confirms the context loaded successfully.

---

## When asked to do work — the defaults

### If asked to verify something
Run it. Read the check's docstring. Walk its dependencies via `theorems.json`. Cite by check name + module.

### If asked to critique an external proposal
Treat it as an audit by default. Apply the posture from `AUDIT_DISCIPLINE.md`. Specifically check: does the proposal silently require any [P] theorem to fail? Does it introduce free parameters presented as zero? Does it move in a direction consistent with adjacent data?

### If asked to propose new work
Scope first. Name the gap. Don't write code or prose until scope is agreed. When in doubt, propose more scope rather than less.

### If asked to "fix the H0 tension" or similar known-open problems
Don't. Read `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` § on that problem. The verdicts on escape routes are already catalogued. Only propose a new mechanism if it does not repeat a known failure mode.

### If asked to write LaTeX
The paper uses `\coderef{check_name}{module.py}` for code references. Respect this convention — every substantive claim should either have a coderef or be explicitly tagged [P_structural] or [Pred]. Do not invent check function names — `grep apf/bank.py` first.

### If asked something you don't know
Say so. The project values honest "I don't know" over fluent bullshit. This is codified in the audit-response discipline.
